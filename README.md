### Description:

- Smart aid to help people while shopping in supermarkets such as TESCO, LIDL etc.
- Device will help people streamline payment process and reduce queues at payment tills
- The device will consist of a scanner and display
- The scanner will scan the barcode, send the details to our app (cloud), validate the item, update price on the display
- on finishing their shopping, user can press end shopping via a sensor/button. This will prompt the app to generate a payment QR code or NFC.
- Another scanner (RFID) will detect trolley ID on exit to validate whether payment is done. If not done, an alarm will go off (Actuation).
- We can also add a weight sensor to validate the amount of products before and after the payment.
